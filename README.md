Taskem is a way to browse and maintain your tasks and goals on any iPhone device.
Keep an eye on your tasks with the ability to view everything. The projectâ€™s goal is to show 
practices of using VIPER architecture and Unit Testing in iOS using swift 5. In addition,
the app has an example of code with Unit Test coverage.

## Key Features ##

### VIPER ###

This project's code follows the [VIPER][viper-url] 
pattern, first [introduced by Mutual Mobile][mutual mobile-url]. 
VIPER is an implementation of Clean Architecture to iOS apps.
The word VIPER is a backronym for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity,
and Routing. Additionally, the app
uses ViewModels to represent screens data.

### Unit Testing ###

The app has an example of Unit Testing which includes more than 500+ test cases.
[Nimble][nimble-url] is a framework which was used in unit testing.
For the most of Test Doubles structures as mock, stub, dummy and spy was used 
code generation [utility][mock-generator-url].

### Firebase ###

[Firebase][firebase-url] is Google's real time NoSQL Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform that can ##
stream data to millions of users at the same time through the power of Websocket.

This app demonstrates basic actions which can be made without any backend code.

### Code generation ###

Also, for ease of coding, there were used code generation utilities:

- [Generamba][generamba-url] - generation of all VIPER skeletons,
- [Sourcery][sourcery-url] - creating auto generated Equatable protocol realizations,
- [Swiftgen][swiftgen-url] - conversion of images, colors into swift structures,
- [SwiftMockGeneratorForXcode][mock-generator-url] - utility for Test Doubles generation.

## Instalation ##

The project uses [CocoaPods][pods-url] and [Carthage][carthage-url] for dependencies management.
In case you don't use any of the mentioned above:

- ```sudo gem install cocoapods```
- ```brew install carthage``` or use another [method][carthage-install-url]

### Compilation ###

In order to compile Taskem you need to do the following:

- ```pod install```
- ```carthage update --platform iOS```

The app uses firebase services, so you have to create your own firebase project in the [Firebase Console][firebase-installation-url] and generate a ```.plist``` file. The projects has two types of these ```.plist``` files which are used in Production and Development schemes.

Also there are two files of color palettes. Which need to drop into ```~/Library/Colors``` folder.

- [```TaskemLists.clr```][license-url]
- [```TaskemMain.clr```][license-url]

For debugging use the Development scheme.
